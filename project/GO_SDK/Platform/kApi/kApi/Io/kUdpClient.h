 * * The receiver should bind on the group port and 'any' address (kIpAddress_AnyV4()).
 * * The receiver should join the multicast group, specifying the group address and the

 * * The sender should bind on the desired local interface address for outgoing 
 *   multicast datagrams. The sender can use any port (e.g., an ephemeral port via kIP_PORT_ANY).  
 *
 * Note that while some platforms support binding the receiver to the group address (e.g., Linux) 
 * other platforms do not (e.g., Windows). Accordingly, the advice given above is to bind the receiver 
 * to 'any' address, which works on all platforms. Unfortunately, this means that any unicast or 
 * broadcast datagrams that are addressed to the same port identifier may also be received by the
