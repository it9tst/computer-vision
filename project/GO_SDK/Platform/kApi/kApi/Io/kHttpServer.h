/**
 * @class   kHttpServer
 * @extends kObject
 * @ingroup kApi-Io
 * @brief   Implements a simple HTTP server.
 * 
 * The kHttpServer class implements a simple HTTP 1.1 server framework. The kHttpServer_SetHandler function 
 * can be used to register a callback function to process remote requests.  The 'args' parameter to this callback 
 * receives a kHttpServerChannel instance, which can be used to access kHttpServerRequest and 
 * kHttpServerResponse objects. These request/response objects can be used to parse an incoming request 
 * and to format an outgoing response, respectively.
 * 
 * kHttpServer uses a simple thread-per-connection model, where the maximum number of simultaneous connections
 * can be configured using the kHttpServer_SetMaxConnections function. Accordingly, kHttpServer is better suited 
 * to small/embedded applications than large-scale web applications.
