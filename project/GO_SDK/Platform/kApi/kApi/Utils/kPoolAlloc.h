/**
 * @class   kPoolAlloc
 * @ingroup kApi-Utils
 * @brief   Allocates small buffers from larger blocks and/or caches deallocated buffers for later reuse.
 * 
 * This memory allocator can be used to improve performance in some circumstances. It can reduce the number 
 * of individual requests to an underlying allocator by allocating multiple small memory buffers from larger 
 * blocks. It can also cache deallocated buffers for later reuse, reducing the frequency of allocation requests
 * made to the underlying allocator. 
 * 
 * For each memory request, a 'rank' is determined by calculating the base-2 logarithm of the requested size and then 
 * rounding up. The rank determines the true size of the buffer that will be allocated (requests are rounded up to 
 * the nearest power of two). Rank-based buffer management provides simple organization and fast reallocation; the 
 * cost is increased memory space. 
 * 
 * Parameters are provided to control which ranks should be allocated from larger blocks, which ranks should 
 * be cached upon deallocation, memory capacities, etc. Memory can be reserved using the kPoolAlloc_Reserve
 * and kPoolAlloc_ReserveAt functions, and/or dynamically allocated from the underlying allocator as needed. 
 * 
 * The operations provided in this class should be used in the following order: 
 * - Construct a kPoolAlloc instance.
 * - Perform configuration.
 * - Use the kPoolAlloc_Start method to prepare the allocator for use.
 * - Use the kPoolAlloc_Reserve or kPoolAlloc_ReserveAt methods to make pre-emptive allocations.
 * - Use the kAlloc_Get/kAlloc_Free methods to perform allocations/deallocations.
 * - Destroy the kPoolAlloc instance when no longer needed. 
 * 
 * All outstanding memory allocations must be freed before destroying the allocator.
